# Formally specify the following system using Petri Nets
- Using Petri grids, formalize the following system
 We have a traffic intersection that regulates the flow of four different lanes
 Only certain signals can be green at a specific time and the rest are red
- The two signals in lanes 1 can be green at the same time, and the rest of the signals are red
- The two lights in lanes 2 can be green at the same time, and the rest of the lights are red
- The signal in lane 3 can be green and the rest of the lights are red
- The signal in lane 4 can be green and the rest of the lights are red
- The signal in lane 5 can be green and the rest of the lights are red
